Do you want to work or game and simultaneously view a video or a webpage, but 'splitting' your screen is no option?
Then you need **Flobro**! With Flobro you can add a browser window to your screen that floats on top, so you can work or game and watch at the same time.  

Flobro is disctraction free, so no browser interface bugging on top.
